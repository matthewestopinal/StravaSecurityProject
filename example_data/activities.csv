Finish was strong which is always a good sign. UGA was doing some weird progressive run which kinda threw me off the pack because I didn‚Äôt want to blow up early. Resulted in me running alone for everything past the 1st mile. Stayed green the entire race, only passed and wasn‚Äôt passed by anyone else. A decent rust buster but üëÄ to run a bit faster in two weeks.

Official time of 1:00:31 grabs the segment with a 5:24 average pace. It‚Äôs been a dream of mine for a while to run the fastest time on the 11.2, and today was really fun. Just kept a solid effort the whole way with the foot on the gas, worked the hills, thought I was going to keel over on 9 mile hill, but once we made it up, let out a smile and told Pesto that ‚Äúwe got this‚Äù. Strava gave Pesto a GAP of 5:24 from 5:40, so I guess this was around 5:08-5:10 GAP for the effort. Pleased with the shape I‚Äôm in right now, sub 60 on the 11.2 is definitely possible. Let out a few tears as we passed the 10 mile post because I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve dreamed of doing this as fast as we did when I was a freshman doing it for the first time. Dreams definitely became a reality today and for that I feel incredibly thankful and blessed. Still gotta keep in mind that this is just training and nobody cares unless you perform in a race.

This was the first time I‚Äôve had fun with racing in a really long time even though it wasn‚Äôt exactly the result I wanted. One of my best friends on my high school cross country team, Gunnar Schultz, passed away in a car accident in November. Gunnar was always there to motivate me when I struggled in high school and was one of the best/selfless teammates someone could ever ask for (attaching screenshot of the last text he sent me). Tonight I got to wear my high school singlet in honor of him and I felt him with me through the whole race. I desperately miss him, but even now I know he‚Äôll always be here to pick me up when I‚Äôm down. 

Race details - coach wanted me to go really conservative at 9:00-9:05 through 3k and so I came through 3k at 9:02 but my group was really slowing down. Had to run alone the final 2k trying to catch the front pack but it was a massive grind.
